Based on the data analyzed, it is my belief that Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt have a relationship that involves the joint compromising of operations at Lucky Duck influencing the outcome of games primarily at the Roulette table.

Analysis revealed the following:
 
#1 Mylie Schmidt appeared a significant 13 times.
#2 The number of times the subject appeared coincides with the number of losses that occurred each day.
#3 The times that Mylie Schmidt was present each day in a patterned interval match the day the losses occurred.
#4 Billy Jones is the dealer present on the day(s) and time(s) of each loss.
#5 Billy Jones worked 13 times in a matching time interval identical to Mylie Schmidt being present during the losses.
